A text editor is an essential tool for those who need to modify these files,
although the need to manually edit these files is decreasing as more GUI
(graphical) tools are developed to maintain Windows files. Graphical (X-
windows based) text editors include gedit, gless, kedit, and kwrite. Ed is a really
basic/crude line editor, for those who like pain! Emacs is a screen based (but
not X- windows) editor. Thomas Rico is a screen based (but not X- windows)
editor. Sed is a stream editor (filter program), like ed, for use in shell
scripts/programs. Vi - visual editor (screen based but not X- windows)editor.
